<summary><strong> [OPTIONAL] Setup Upstreams</strong></summary>

**Note**: An upstream repository is the original Toucans-Team-23 repository.

Once you have forked as directed in the previous section, you would not be following changes made here, in the original repository.

**What you can do is:**
 - cd to the directory of the forked repo you cloned above.
 - Run a command to add upstreams
 ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/chingu-voyage5/Toucans-Team-23.git

  git fetch upstream
  git checkout -b upstream/master
  git pull upstream master

 ```
 **To return to your branch on your fork**
  - Run
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

#### Next steps

You are all good to start contributing. You might however want to
make sure you periodically update the `origin/master` branch which is from your fork, with the content from `upstream/master` which is this repository's dev branch.

**Why?**
Because, Just before you submit Pull requests, or before you even change a feature, you **Need** to ensure you have all the latest changes from upstream.

This is a healthy habit to inculcate, and would ease out headaches later.

Also, Before you do the above , and begin coding something new, or modifying existing stuff, make sure you have **merged**.

the simplest is a fast forward merge

` git merge upstream/master`
But merges are complicated. Please do read official documentation on merge. Understand how they work. And then proceed to a PR.
